## Goals
- Time-to-First-Value (TTFV) ≤ 30 days
- Exec sponsorship confirmed and meeting cadence set
- Success Plan (MAP) agreed with measurable outcomes and owners

## Roles & RACI
- **Customer Sponsor (A/R):** owns outcomes, removes blockers  
- **Project Lead (R):** day-to-day implementation, timelines  
- **CSM (A):** success plan, cadence, risk management, value delivery  
- **SE / PS (C):** technical enablement, integrations  
- **Support (C):** tickets, severity handling

## Timeline
**Week 0 (Pre-kickoff)**
- Discovery notes reviewed, key use cases prioritized
- Access & prerequisites checklist confirmed (SSO, data sources, APIs)
- Draft Success Plan & KPI baseline

**Week 1 (Kickoff)**
- Agenda: intros, desired outcomes, scope, milestones, risks, comms plan
- Confirm sponsor cadence (monthly exec sync or QBR schedule)
- Finalize project tracker (Jira/Asana/Sheet) + owners

**Weeks 2–4 (Enablement & Config)**
- Complete core setup (integrations, roles, SSO)
- Train primary users (101 + use-case training)
- Validate first outcome milestone → record TTFV

**Weeks 5–8 (Adoption & Wins)**
- Weekly office hours
- Track usage & adoption KPIs, capture 1–2 “win” stories
- Prep first value review with sponsor

**Weeks 9–12 (Stabilize & Scale)**
- Transition to BAU cadence (bi-weekly)
- Introduce 2nd use case; build expansion hypotheses
- Lock QBR date; finalize 90-day readout

## Cadences
- **Project standup:** weekly, 30 min (tactical)
- **Sponsor sync:** monthly, 30 min (outcomes/risks/asks)
- **Office hours:** weekly, 45 min (how-to + unblockers)

## Metrics & Health
- Activation complete (Y/N), TTFV (days), Weekly Active Users
- Feature adoption (% of target personas)
- Support: #tickets, Sev distribution, time to resolution
- Value milestones achieved vs. plan

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Sponsor change:** secure alt exec; shorten cadence; recap outcomes
- **Low adoption:** role-based training + in-app prompts; focus on 1 high-value workflow
- **Integration delay:** parallelize training; provide mocked data or staged rollout

## Artifacts & Templates
- Success Plan / MAP (owners, milestones, metrics, dates)
- Project tracker (tasks, dependencies, status)
- Training plan (personas, sessions, recordings)
- Runbooks: [QBR Playbook](../playbooks/QBR-playbook.md), [Renewal Runbook](../playbooks/Renewal-runbook.md)

## Exit Criteria (Onboarding Complete)
- Success Plan baselined; 2 value milestones achieved
- Sponsor cadence booked through next QBR
- Support & escalation paths confirmed
- Handoff doc stored in shared workspace
